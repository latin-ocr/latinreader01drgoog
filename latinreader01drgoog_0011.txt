PREFACE.

'lun Latin Reader, now offered to the public, forms part ot ι
work well known in Germany‚ under the title os “Lateiuiatlres
Elementarbuch sum offentlicheu und Putat-Gebrauche rou
Friedrich Jacobs und Friedrich wilhelm Dounga The Ger·
man edition consiste of six parts, ol which the lst aad 2ud are
comprised in this volume. The {lrd contains extracta stom
Caesar, Curtius Rufus, Livy, Sallust, and Tacitns5 the tuis
made up ol excerpts from Cicero’s Epistles aad Orationsy the
5th is composed of selectione stom ovid, Martial, end the An·
thologia Latinay and the oth embraces parta of Catullus, Τί·
bullus, Propertius, Lucretius, Virgil, und Seneca. As this lit·
tle book is intended merely to give the leamer such an ac·
quaintance with the fundamental principles of the Latin lan·
guage as will enable him to enter with advantage upon the
stndy of the preparatory course for our College, it has been
deemed advisable to omit the contents of the last four volumes.

A part of thern is contained iu the course lor entrance, and the
rest is too difficult sor mere beginners.

lt maybe necessary here to state the reason lor publishing
a New Yorlr edition, when one has already been issued from
the Boston press. 1t will be readily aclrnowledged, thet is the
assistance ot* notes is necessary to the learnar in Germany,
where the advantages in classical instruction are incomparably ³
greater than in our country, they arc much more requisita to ³
the American pupil. lt has heen the object ol' the editor, there-
sore, to supply this deficiency in the previous American edi- ,
tions. Most of Q Notes have been translated from the Ger-
man ; others hdve been supplied, which the superior state of in·
struction on the Continent would render unnecessary there. ς

n rs nopes that aa uera wora may ue round serviceabte to '
those who use it, aud contribute in some degree to the adraucc-
mont ol sound elementary educatiou.
